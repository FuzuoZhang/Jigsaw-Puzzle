#### Jigsaw Puzzle

-----

Jigsaw Puzzle is a well-known problem to recover a image from many small pieces of the origin image. I implement the method presented by  Yu etl, it's funny to run the program. 

Files in the project:

- main.py : The source code written in Python3, if you run it in you PC, you need to revise the path of the input image.
- images: Images which I used to test for my program.
- test-output: Some samples (including the mixed images and the output images recovered by the program) performance well.
- Paper: Two papers which I mainly referenced.
